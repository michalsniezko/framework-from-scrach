# framework-from-scratch
A PHP-based MVC framework that I wrote from scratch as an exercise.

This framework features:
- MVC organised code (Models, Views and Controllers Core)
- An advanced router based on regular expressions
- Classes organized into namespaces with autoloading
- Controllers including action filters
- Views with the Twig template engine
- Models with resource-friendly database connectivity
- Environment-specific configuration and error handling
